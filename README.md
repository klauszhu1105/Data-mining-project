# Data-mining-project
This project explores data classification challenges and addresses them through the systematic application of data balancing methods, feature selection techniques, and machine learning algorithms.
Using R programming and the RStudio environment, 36 combinations of methods were evaluated to identify the optimal approach for handling class imbalance and improving model accuracy. Data preprocessing steps, including outlier handling, normalization, and missing value treatment, ensured a clean and structured dataset. The study revealed that the combination of the ROSE balancing method, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) yielded the best results, achieving a high F1-Score of 0.874. This combination demonstrated a robust balance between precision and recall, effectively managing class imbalance and optimizing feature relevance. Conversely, the least accurate combination highlighted the limitations of alternative approaches, reinforcing the importance of strategic method selection. The findings underscore the significance of preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation in developing effective classification systems, offering valuable insights for future research in data mining and machine learning applications.
